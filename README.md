# Dapanoskop

> From Greek δαπάνη (dapáni, "cost") + σκοπέω (skopéo, "to observe") — the cost observer.

Dapanoskop is an opinionated approach to cloud cost monitoring. Rather than trying to be everything to everyone, it makes deliberate architectural choices about how cloud spending should be tracked, analyzed, and acted upon.
